          innovation – both technological and intellectual – which, as our name
          declares, combines the practical and the idealistic. We publish pieces
          by a variety of thinkers on a variety topics, freely traversing styles
          and perspectives. No matter the style, discipline, or subject matter,
          we value systems thinking, actionable idealism, and beauty—because
          without beauty, it’s all for nought."
